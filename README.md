# coderbyte-connect4-kata

timed coderbyte live coding challenge done in java.

## context

coding test done under time pressure; implement a connect4 game
in the language of your choice, and add display, parsing, validation, 
and win/loss-check methods. was not able to complete test in 30 minutes.


## post-mortem

gave myself 3 hours to come up with an elegant solve; took me a week to
create a solution that flows well and is readable.

this specific challenge is **_not_** a good test of on-your-feet development IMO;
the solution begs for one to know it beforehand, and off-by-one errors will
eat into what little development time is given. if the scenario here was to
emulate a high-stress coding session, then it would have achieved said goal,
but doing this in the context of projects for the fintech space makes the 
high-pressure activity  suspect.


coderbyte is also a weak and buggy testing / live programming platform. editing
on the IDE window often kicks up ghost actions on the scratchpad window, adding
a layer of futzing around on top of everything else.

## wip

put in  maven tests
